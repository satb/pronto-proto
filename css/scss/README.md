# Main file

The main file (usually labelled `main.scss`) should be the only Sass file from the whole code base not to begin with an underscore. This file should not contain anything but `@import` and comments.

*Note: when using [Eyeglass](https://github.com/sass-eyeglass/eyeglass) for distribution, it might be a fine idea to name this file `index.scss` rather than `main.scss` in order to stick to [Eyeglass modules specifications](https://github.com/sass-eyeglass/eyeglass#writing-an-eyeglass-module-with-sass-files). See [#21](https://github.com/HugoGiraudel/sass-boilerplate/issues/21) for reference.*


In order to preserve readability, the main file should respect these guidelines:

-------------------------
    one file per @import;
    one @import per line;
    no new line between two imports from the same folder;
    a new line after the last import from a folder;
    file extensions and leading underscores omitted.

@import 'abstracts/variables';
@import 'abstracts/functions';
@import 'abstracts/mixins';
@import 'abstracts/placeholders';

@import 'vendors/bootstrap';
@import 'vendors/jquery-ui';

@import 'base/reset';
@import 'base/typography';

@import 'layout/navigation';
@import 'layout/grid';
@import 'layout/header';
@import 'layout/footer';
@import 'layout/sidebar';
@import 'layout/forms';

@import 'components/buttons';
@import 'components/carousel';
@import 'components/cover';
@import 'components/dropdown';

@import 'pages/home';
@import 'pages/contact';

@import 'themes/theme';
@import 'themes/admin';


OR

------------------------

There is another way of importing partials that I deem valid as well. On the bright side, it makes the file more readable. On the other hand, it makes updating it slightly more painful. Anyway, Iâ€™ll let you decide which is best, it does not matter much. For this way of doing, the main file should respect these guidelines:

    one @import per folder;
    a linebreak after @import;
    each file on its own line;
    a new line after the last import from a folder;
    file extensions and leading underscores omitted.


@import
  'abstracts/variables',
  'abstracts/functions',
  'abstracts/mixins',
  'abstracts/placeholders';

@import
  'vendors/bootstrap',
  'vendors/jquery-ui';

@import
  'base/reset',
  'base/typography';

@import
  'layout/navigation',
  'layout/grid',
  'layout/header',
  'layout/footer',
  'layout/sidebar',
  'layout/forms';

@import
  'components/buttons',
  'components/carousel',
  'components/cover',
  'components/dropdown';

@import
  'pages/home',
  'pages/contact';

@import
  'themes/theme',
  'themes/admin';

About globbing

In computer programming, glob patterns specify sets of filenames with wildcard characters, such as *.scss. To a general extend, globbing means matching a set of files based on an expression instead of a list of filenames. When applied to Sass, it means importing partials into the main file with a glob pattern rather than by listing them individually. This would lead to a main file looking like this:

@import 'abstracts/*';
@import 'vendors/*';
@import 'base/*';
@import 'layout/*';
@import 'components/*';
@import 'pages/*';
@import 'themes/*';

Sass does not support file globbing out of the box because it can be a dangerous feature as CSS is known to be order-dependant. When dynamically importing files (which usually goes in alphabetical order), one does not control the source order anymore, which can lead to hard to debug side-effects.

That being said, in a strict component-based architecture with extra care not to leak any style from one partial to the other, the order should not really matter anymore, which would allow for glob imports. This would make it easier to add or remove partials as carefully updating the main file would no longer be required.

When using Ruby Sass, there is a Ruby gem called sass-globbing that enables exactly that behavior. If running on node-sass, one can rely either on Node.js, or whatever build tool they use to handle the compilation (Gulp, Grunt, etc.).  

------------------------
Shame file

There is an interesting concept that has been made popular by Harry Roberts, Dave Rupert and Chris Coyier that consists of putting all the CSS declarations, hacks and things we are not proud of in a shame file. This file, dramatically titled _shame.scss, would be imported after any other file, at the very end of the stylesheet.

/**
 * Nav specificity fix.
 *
 * Someone used an ID in the header code (`#header a {}`) which trumps the
 * nav selectors (`.site-nav a {}`). Use !important to override it until I
 * have time to refactor the header stuff.
 */
.site-nav a {
    color: #BADA55 !important;
}
