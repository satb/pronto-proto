# Components

For small components, there is the `components/` folder. While `layout/` is macro (defining the global wireframe), `components/` is more focused on widgets. It contains all kind of specific modules like a slider, a loader, a widget, and basically anything along those lines. There are usually a lot of files in components/ since the whole site/application should be mostly composed of tiny modules.

    _media.scss
    _carousel.scss
    _thumbnails.scss

The components/ folder might also be called modules/, depending on what you prefer.
